ðŸ§  Deep Learning Model - Classification Project
This project is a deep learning model built using Keras. It classifies data using a neural network and was trained and tuned using Keras Tuner. The model is also ready for deployment using Flask and Docker.

âœ… What This Project Does
Loads a dataset

Builds a neural network with 3 hidden layers

Tunes the model using Keras Tuner

Trains the model for 50 epochs

Tracks accuracy and loss during training

Can serve predictions using an API (optional)

ðŸ§ª Training Highlights (Epochs 31â€“50)
Epoch	Accuracy	Val Accuracy
31	91.47%	91.47%
40	94.31%	75.07%
45	95.57%	89.12%
50	94.96%	93.93%

The model kept improving and reached up to 94.96% training accuracy and 93.93% validation accuracy.

Training logs show small overfitting, but overall stable performance
